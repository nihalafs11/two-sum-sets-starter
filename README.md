# two-sum-pairs-starter

Beginner Python exercise repo focused on lists, for-loops, and append using the two-sum (pairs that add to T) problem.

## Learning goals
- Loop over lists with elements and indices
- Build results with append
- Reason about duplicates and order
- Read test failures and fix code

## Function under test

Implement in `two_sum.py` and return a list:

```python
def two_sum_pairs(numbers, target):
    ...
```
